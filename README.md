A Tennis Scoring System
This code will score only a SINGLE game of Tennis.
It does not score for SETS or for the Match.

The index styling is stored in site.css
The logic is in tennis_check_score.php
This checks for the score description, deuce, advantage and winner.

The database connection is stored seperately for security

The index.php only allows for the user to start a game, score points for a player by clicking the related button, and displays the score.
